        <h2><em> History: TechCon</em></h2>
        TechCon, founded in 2005 as a small tech gathering in Silicon Valley,
        has evolved into a premier global technology conference. Initially
        focused on software, hardware, and web development, TechCon grew rapidly
        with the rise of smartphones, social media, and AI, attracting major
        companies and innovators. By 2015, it expanded internationally,
        highlighting emerging technologies like AI, cybersecurity, and
        blockchain. Today, TechCon is a global event with over 50,000 attendees,
        shaping the future of tech innovation and addressing critical issues
        like sustainability and digital ethics.
        <p><strong>The Birth of TechCon (2005)</strong></p>
        TechCon was first conceived as a regional event that would unite local
        tech minds to discuss the rising trends in software, hardware, and web
        development. The conference featured just a few speakers, including key
        figures from emerging tech companies that would later dominate the
        global stage. Held in a modest conference room, the inaugural TechCon
        gathered around 300 attendees.

        unveiling of groundbreaking products and software that would shape the
